# Python-Intermediate-Projects
This repository is created to demonstrate the python learning journey that I undertake in and show the kind of intermediate or advanced minor learning projects that I do to demonstrate my python proficiency.
Also this repository also includes all the intermediate level projects that encompass the python projects that I do.
Thanks and Namaste. :))
